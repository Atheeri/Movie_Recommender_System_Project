# Movie_Recommender_System_Project
Various recommender systems are used in various fields, such as playlists for video and music services, product recommendations for online stores, and content recommendations for social media platforms. In this project, we are creating a movie recommendation. The dataset was found from the movies/tv rating website called IMDB. The website includes data from nearly all the movies, tv, shorts and web videos in existence. The original dataset was acquired from datasets.imdbws.com which is a self hosted link from the creators of the website. The dataset consists of 7 TSV files totaling 7 GB of data. In modern society, due to the prevalence of the Internet, people have too many choices to choose from, which is why we need a recommender system. As an example, Netflix has a large selection of movies. People have a hard time selecting the items that they actually want to see, even though the amount of available information has increased. Recommender systems can help with this
